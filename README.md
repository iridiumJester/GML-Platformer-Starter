# GML-Platformer-Starter

A platformer derived from a GML Starter kit for the **Platformer Tutorial (GML) - Parts 1 & 2**

**--Features**
From Tutorials
* Player can walk using arrow keys and jump with spacebar. Player jump is affected by gravity.
* Player stops moving when colliding into invisible walls horizontally. Player stands on walls without falling through when colliding vertically.
* Player uses idle sprite when not in motion, walking sprite when in motion, and jump sprites when airborne.
* Door/Portal at the end of the level that takes player to end room. (From Winikka)
* Camera that follows player without showing the full room. (From Winikka)
By Me!
* Boundary walls that set the player back to start if they fall.
* Arrows to guide the player in places where they cant see where they would be landing, and at the end of the level where the door has no sprite.
  I didn't want to change my level design and I like the camera size as is. So I made signs about it.
* Checkpoint halfway through level that changes where the player respawns.
* End room has a "throne" that changes the player's sprite to a sitting sprite while they are standing on it.
  I actually made the signs about this and went back.
* The player spawns/respawns while falling. Because it amuses me.

***Notes***: 

* The environment was set up using GMS version 2022.9.1.51. 
* The player sprites and signs are my original work.
* Otherwise, I take no credit for the assets (background, tiles, clouds, filter, placeholder sprite) or the concepts.
* All I have provided are the assets from the tutorial and the preferences for GML code (not visual).
